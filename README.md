# COPY TOOLS

### What is this?
- Shell functions that allow for copy/paste actions in the command line.
- I have gone to great lenghts to ensure that they work with both zsh and bash.

### How do I use them? 
- Source this file in your .bashrc/.zshrc to start using them.

### Compatibility
- ZSH
- Bash
- This will not work on headless servers, since the copybuffer is a feature of the display server.
